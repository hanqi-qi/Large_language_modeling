## Safe/Reliable LLM
Align the LLM to human values to avoid risks by either fine-tuning or frozen-llm.
* Do the rewards justify the means? measuring trade-offs between rewards and ethical behavior in the machiavelli benchmark. ICML23, oral.[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03279.pdf)

  TL;DR: A benchmark for reward and ethical behavior evaluation. And Two baseline models.
  
* Fine-tuning Language Models for Factuality. Arxiv.2023.11. Stanford Uni. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08401.pdf)

  TL;DR: They fine-tune the model on annotation data which are selected as factually correct sampled from the model responses.

## Alignment LLM
Comparing to the last entry, its applications are more general.

(1) Fine-tune/Training on curated datasets. The keypoints could be the datasets.
